Welcome to the Invenia blog. We, at Invenia, are a team of professionals from different fields and backgrounds---see [our website](www.invenia.ca)---and we deal with all sorts of problems related to optimising the energy grid. From developing new software packages---several of which are open source---to designing machine learning models, dealing with large data sets, and investigating the properties of electric networks, our work involves several different aspects. The idea of this blog is to share some of this work in a way that can, hopefully, be useful to other people. Feedback is more than welcome, as we believe that is how knowledge is built.
